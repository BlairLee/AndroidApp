Please check out the following branches in order
1. 1_basic_info_ui: basic info part of the main UI
2. 2_main_ui: all the main UI
3. 3_fake_data: make the UI display fake data
4. 4_master: the complete version

Current branch: 3_fake_data

Goals:
In this branch, instead of hard coding the content of the UI in activity_main.xml, we fake data
in MainActivity.java and use Java code to display the fake data onto the UI.

Remember what making UI is about? It's all about displaying and manipulating the data! You have just
learned how to display it! Congratulations!

Workflow:
Check out the todos and follow the instructions.
Check out "preview.png" to see what it should look like.

Challenge:
Finish Experience and Project part (use Education as a reference)

Advise:
If you have some questions, it is better to search in google(baidu) before asking someone else. You need PRACTICE to learn how to get what you what.
If you can not find answer, feel free to post your question in jiuzhang.com/qa or QQ group.
You can see complete code(including code of Challenge) in "master" branch.
It is always the last step to compare your code with "master"
